        <p>A "black panther" is not its own species—it's an umbrella term that refers to any big cat with a black coat. The coloring comes from a surplus of melanin, the pigment responsible for suntans, and an animal with the condition is known as "melanistic."</p>

        <p>Also, just because black panthers are dark in color doesn't mean they don't have spots—they're just harder to see.</p>
